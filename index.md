<h1>Azam Din</h1>{: .text-center .text-h1}
<p>Data Scientist & ML Engineer</p>{: .text-center .text-h2}

I am an experienced Data Scientist specialising in NLP, conversational AI and signal processing.  My core strengths are in engineering robust ML/data pipelines, cloud infrastructure and MLOps tooling & processes.

My current role is as a Research Data Scientist for a SaaS offering in the Sales Enablement space where I am building text processing pipelines (NLP), voice feature extractors and content recommenders. As a newly established data science team I am also responsible for maturing the companies ML tooling and processes and I strive to upskill and mentor my fellow Data Scientists to improve engineering quality and standards.

With my MEng degree in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering I specialised in instrumentation and data acquisition systems.  I have led a wide range of analytical projects across various industries including automotive, oil & gas and IT. I am passionate about automating complex processes and building novel machine learning solutions.
